# Field_Data_Analysis
## Field Data Analysis and Automated Feature validation from crowd sourced field photos

For understanding the relevance and extracting information from crowd sourcing photos for Geospatial technology, object detection and 
text recognition will be used which will enable the extraction of information and a separate database will be created for storing images 
of the region of text slots, text data, object description obtained from the image and hence the whole process will be automated for 
higher efficiency and reliability.

Programming Language: Python
Modules: imageAI, imageai.detection, Tensorflow, Keras, opencv-python, imutils.object_detection, numpy, pytesseract, argparse, cv2, Raster Vision
Algorithms: ResNet algorithm, EAST algorithm
